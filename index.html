               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My first professional title was Massage Therapist (MT). 
                  I was 18 years old when I took a Reiki class at the suggestion of my friend. That class introduced me to the "healing arts" and 
                  helped me to get in touch with my sensitivity and empathy. From there, it was another 2 years before I enrolled in a massage therapy program and that was one of the most transformative experiences of my life. Not only did I learn about muscle function and ways to address common
                  injuries, I also learned a lot about the mind body connection and how our emotions influence our physical body and health.  
                  For 9 years, I worked an MT, and in addition to the hard skills I developed as an MT I also developed important and transferrable soft skills such as time management, flexibility, self-motivation and responsibility.

               <p class="jobDescription">During my time working as an MT, I embarked on the journey to completing my bachelor's degree. Through massage therapy I felt it important to develop my communication skills with the intention to become a counselor. While I did not fulfill the original intention, my educational experience and subsequent professional experience has been invaluable. I was able to land a full time job with the agency where I completed my field study while a student at Temple University. Through the agency I had the opportunity to participate in many of the programs available at the agency such as refugee resettlement, the veterans program, the welfare to work program and disaster relief. 
               I further honed my soft skills and developed more hard skills such as program management, organization and technical skills.

            <h2>Intro to Programming</h2>

               <p class="jobDescription">It was a surprise to myself as well as anyone when I took an interest in computer programs. After years believing I was technologically inept I found myself enjoying the time I spent working on computers. First, in a social research class for my undergrad, we used SPSS, a software program used in social statistical analysis. Unlike many of my classmates, I enjoyed the time I spent analysing the data I acquired through one of my social research projects. Likewise, in my professional role, I looked forward to the end of the month when I had to complete the monthly case management reports. More and more I wanted to spend time working on the computer until one of my friends suggested I look into business analysis. This friend introduced me to SQL and the w3schools website, and thus commenced my journey to web development. I spent a great amount of time researching and practicing JavaScript and some very basic Python in an effort to become employable. I had almost given up on the idea that I would ever be an employable programmer when I saw an ad for LaunchCode's part time LC101 program. Five months had passed since I last practiced code and I decided 'why not?'. My most recent job reminded me that if I'm going to spend 8 or 9 hours a day doing something, it might as well be something I enjoy. </p>
